1. When I looked at the peace I felt beautiful. This woman could be me.   
2. Very rarely do African-Americans enter art museums and find amazing, huge, oil canvas paintings of people who look like them. I think Wiley's work is revolutionary.   
3. My “understanding” is that the artist wanted to show people of today. His neighbors, his brothers, his sisters; a rare form that gets the audience thinking. At first when you see the painting, you think "she doesn't belong there." The colors are too bright and the woman should be some waif with pale skin. This piece makes you rethink your stereotypes and makes you wonder if she *should've* been there all along.

1. The invitees to the Creative Artist Agencies *Oscar* viewing party.
2. The purpose is to tell the invitees about the party:
  * it’s date
  * where it is (kinda)
  * how to RSVP
3. The problem is relaying the information. They wanted the invitation to fit their Old Hollywood theme.
