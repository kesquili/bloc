# About Kelli
Hi Dennis! I'm from *Washington, DC* but I'm currently living in **Dallas, TX**.
I have lived in many cities:

1. Hampton, VA
2. Brooklyn, NY
3. Atlanta, GA
  * I only lived here for a few weeks so that barely counts! *

I am also a *graphic designer* and have been designing for **5 years**. Here is a link to my [portfolo.] (http://www.behance.net/kelliesquilin)

I joined Blco because I needed to upgrade my career. Most jobs want their designers to have **UX/UI experience** as well as some **coding skills.** I'm hoping that through this program I can gain both. I've also been critiqued *incredibly harsh* during my last design postion so I'm hoping that I can reaffirm my personal faith in my design skills as well as some critique from a real designer.
