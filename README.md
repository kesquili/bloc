1. When I looked at the peace I felt beautiful. This woman could be me.   
2. Very rarely do African-Americans enter art museums and find amazing, huge, oil canvas paintings of people who look like them. I think Wiley's work is revolutionary.   
3. My “understanding” is that the artist wanted to show people of today. His neighbors, his brothers, his sisters; a rare form that gets the audience thinking. At first when you see the painting, you think "she doesn't belong there." The colors are too bright and the woman should be some waif with pale skin. This piece makes you rethink your stereotypes and makes you wonder if she *should've* been there all along.

### Designer Review: Wen Tong 
##### Yelp Redesign

1. Yelp users want to gain more information, from non biased sources, about the businesses and mainly restaurants in their community. 
2. The purpose of the Yelp in general is to provide their users with reviews of local business. The purpose of Tong’s redesign was the make that process more user friendly, visually clearer, and streamlined.
3. Tong’s redesigned fixed two main problems. The first is the clear similarity between the “Nearby” and “Search” option. They both have the same path of execution and shouldn't be two separate options. Tong combined them into one “Search” option. Tong also fixed the similarity between the “Search” and “Action” options.  They both prompted the user to do the same thing and follow many of the same path options instead of being a shortcut like “Action” was supposed to be. Tong changed “Action” to “Feed” which sows what restaurants and business in her social media  friends were frequenting and their reviews.
